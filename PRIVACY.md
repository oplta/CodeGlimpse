# Privacy Policy for CodeGlimpse

**Last Updated:** December 13, 2025

CodeGlimpse ("we", "us", or "our") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how we handle your data when you use the CodeGlimpse macOS application and its Finder extension.

## 1. No Data Collection

**We do not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data, code, files, or usage statistics.**

*   **Offline Operation:** CodeGlimpse operates strictly offline. It does not connect to the internet.
*   **Sandboxed Environment:** The application runs within the macOS App Sandbox, which restricts its access to only the files you explicitly choose to preview (via Quick Look) or open.
*   **No Analytics:** We do not use any third-party analytics or tracking tools (e.g., Google Analytics, Firebase).

## 2. File Access

CodeGlimpse accesses your files **only locally** and **only when you trigger a Quick Look preview** in Finder.
*   This access is read-only.
*   The application processes the file content in memory solely to generate the syntax-highlighted preview.
*   This content is never saved to a database, cached permanently, or sent to any server.

## 3. Data Storage

CodeGlimpse stores only your **user preferences** locally on your device (using `UserDefaults`). This includes:
*   Selected Theme (e.g., "Dracula", "Atom One Dark")
*   Font Size
*   Line Number preferences
*   Performance settings (e.g., max line limit)

This preference data never leaves your device.

## 4. Updates to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Since the application does not collect data, any changes will likely be minor or related to legal requirements. The latest version will always be available on this repository.
